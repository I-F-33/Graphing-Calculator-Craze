- Pressing 'Z' or scrolling your mouse wheel forward zooms the screen in to get an amazing view of a function.
- Pressing 'X' or scrolling your mouse wheel backward zooms the screen out to get a bird's eye view of the function.
- Presing 'C' Clears the current function from the graph.
- Pressing 'F' Allows for you to enter a new function right into the text box.
- Pressing 'R' Resets the graph to its original display, in case you have too much fun using this graphing calculator.

- You can enter text right into the text box by clicking on said text box.
- You cant graph the function by either pressing "ENTER" or clicking on the graph button.
- If you need a little help to nacvigate this Calculator, go ahead and click on "HELP" for a breif refresher.
- Now there's not much else to say other than the cliche "I worked hard on this program and am very proud of the result"
- Soo..go head and have fun.



# Reflections:

  - This project marked the conclusion of my CS3A class, OOP programming with C++. 
  - I learned a ton in this class and have seen those skills translate into other non-C++ projects.
  - I feel as though my fundamentals are strong and am ready to expand my programming horizons. Cheers.
